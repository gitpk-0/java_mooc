/* OBJECT POLYMORPHISM */

/*We've encountered situations where reference-type variables have other types
besides their own one. For example, all objects are of type Object, i.e., any
given object can be represented as a Object-type variable in addition to its
own type.*/

String text = "text";
Object textString = "another string";
String text = "text";
Object textString = text;

/*In the examples above, a string variable is represented as both a String type
and an Object type. Also, a String-type variable is assigned to an Object-type
variable. However, assignment in the other direction, i.e., setting an
Object-type variable to a String type, will not work. This is because
Object-type variables are not of type String*/

Object textString = "another string";
String text = textString; // WON'T WORK!

/*// What is this all about?
In addition to each variable's original type, each variable can also be
represented by the types of interfaces it implements and classes that it
inherits. The String class inherits the Object class and, as such, String
objects are always of type Object. The Object class does not inherit a String
class, so Object-type variables are not automatically of type String. Take a
closer look at the String API documentation, in particular at the top of the
HTML page. 

A screenshot of the String Class API documentation. The screenshot
shows that the String class inherits the class Object. 

The API documentation
for the String class begins with a generic header followed by the class'
package (java.lang). After the package details, the name of the class
(Class String) is followed by the inheritance hierarchy of the class.

  java.lang.Object
   java.lang.String

The inheritance hierarchy lists all the classes that the given class has
inherited. Inherited classes are listed in the order of inheritance, with class
being inspected always at the bottom. In the inheritance hierarchy of the
String class, we see that the String class inherits the Object class. In Java,
each class can inherit one class at most. On the other hand, the inherited
class may have inherited another class. As such, a class may indirectly inherit
more than a single class.

The inheritance hierarchy can also be thought of as a list of the different
types that the class implements.

Knowledge of the fact that objects can be of many different types — of type
Object, for instance — makes programming simpler. If we only need methods
defined in the Object class, such as toString, equals and hashCode in a method,
we can simply use Object as the type of the method parameter. In that case, you
can pass the method for any object as a parameter. Let's take a look at this
with the printManyTimes method. The method gets an Object-type variable and the
number of print operations as its parameters.*/

public class Printer {

    public void printManyTimes(Object object, int times) {
        int i = 0;
        while (i < times) {
            System.out.println(object.toString());
            // or System.out.println(object);

            i = i + 1;
        }
    }
}

/*The method can be given any type of object as a parameter. Within the
printManyTimes method, the object only has access to the methods defined in the
Object class because the object is known in the method to be of type Object.
The object may, in fact, be of another type.*/

Printer printer = new Printer();

String string = " o ";
List<String> words = new ArrayList<>();
words.add("polymorphism");
words.add("inheritance");
words.add("encapsulation");
words.add("abstraction");

printer.printManyTimes(string, 2);
printer.printManyTimes(words, 3);
// Sample output
// o
// o
// [polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction]
// [polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction]
// [polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction]

/*Let's continue to look at the API description of the String class. The
inheritance hierarchy in the description is followed by a list of interfaces
implemented by the class.

  All Implemented Interfaces:
  Serializable, CharSequence, Comparable<String>
  
The String class implements the Serializable, CharSequence, and Comparable
<String> interfaces. An interface is also a type. According to the class' API
description, the following interfaces can be set as the type of a String
object.*/

Serializable serializableString = "string";
CharSequence charSequenceString = "string";
Comparable<String> comparableString = "string";

/*Since we're able to define the type of a method's parameter, we can declare
methods that receive an object that implements a specific interface. When a
method's parameter is an interface, any object that implements that interface
can be passed to it as an argument.

We'll extend the Printer class so that it has a method for printing the
characters of objects that implement the CharSequence interface. The
CharSequence interface provides, among other things, methods int length() for
getting a string's length and char charAt(int index), which retrieves a
character from a given index.*/

public class Printer {

    public void printManyTimes(Object object, int times) {
        int i = 0;
        while (i < times) {
            System.out.println(object);
            i = i + 1;
        }
    }

    public void printCharacters(CharSequence charSequence) {
        int i = 0;
        while (i < charSequence.length()) {
            System.out.println(charSequence.charAt(i));
            i = i + 1;
        }
    }
}

/*The printCharacters method can be passed any object that implements the
CharSequence interface. These include String as well as StringBuilder, which is
often more functional for building strings than String. The printCharacters
method prints each character of a given object on its own line.*/

Printer printer = new Printer();

String string = "works";

printer.printCharacters(string);
// Sample output
// w
// o
// r
// k
// s
