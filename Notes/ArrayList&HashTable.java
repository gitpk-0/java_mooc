/* ARRAY LIST AND HASH TABLE */

/*ArrayList and HashMap are commonly used data structures in programming. We are
now going to take a look at their actual implementation. First we'll remind
ourselves of how to use an array, after which we're going to build a data
structure called List, imitating ArrayList. Then we'll make use of the List to
implement the data structure HashTable.

// A brief recap of arrays
An array is an object that contains a limited number of places for values. The
length (or size) of an array is the number of places in it; in other words, how
many values can be stored in the array. The size of an array is always
predetermined: it is chosen when the array is created, and cannot be changed
later.

The array type is defined with square brackets preceded by the type of the
elements in the array (typeOfElements[]). An array is created with the new
call, followed by the type of the elements in that array, square brackets, and
the number of elements in the array places inside the square brackets.
*/
int[] numbers = new int[3];
String[] strings = new String[5];

/*The elements of the array are referred to by the indexes. Below we create an
integer array of size three, after which we set values to indexes 0 and 2. Then
we print those values.*/

int[] numbers = new int[3];
numbers[0] = 2;
numbers[2] = 5;

System.out.println(numbers[0]);
System.out.println(numbers[2]);
// Sample output
// 2
// 5

/*Setting a single value to a certain position is done similarly to setting a
value to a regular variable, just that when placing the value in an array, you
use the index to indicate the position.

To discover the size of an array you can use the public object variable length
that arrays have. Examining the elements one by one can be accomplished with a
for loop, for instance.*/

int[] numbers = new int[4];
numbers[0] = 42;
numbers[1] = 13;
numbers[2] = 12;
numbers[3] = 7;

System.out.println("There are " + numbers.length + " elements in the array.");

for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}
// Sample output
// There are 4 elements in the array.
// 42
// 13
// 12
// 7

/*Arrays can be used in the exact same manner as other variables, so they can be
object variables, method parameters, return values of methods, and so on.

A significant portion of generally used data structures use arrays in their
internal implementation.

// Lists
Let's examine one way to implement the Java ArrayList data structure. Java
ArrayList uses an array. The type of the elements in the array is defined by
the type parameter given to the ArrayList. Due to this we can add nearly any
type of data to a list. Java List offers multiple methods, but right now add,
contains, remove and get are most relevant for us.*/

ArrayList<String> strings = new ArrayList<>();
System.out.println(strings.contains("Hello!"));
strings.add("Hello!");
System.out.println(strings.contains("Hello!"));
strings.remove("Hello!");
System.out.println(strings.contains("Hello!"));
// Sample output
// false
// true
// false

/*// Creating a new list
Let's create class List. The List has a generic array — the type of the elements
in the array is defined on run time using type parameters. Let's set the size
of the array to 10. The array is created as type object, and changed to type
generic with (A[]) new Object[10]; — this is done because Java does not support
the call new A[10]; for now.*/

public class List<Type> {
    private Type[] values;

    public List() {
        this.values = (Type[]) new Object[10];
    }
}

/*List encapsulates an array. In the beginning, every element in the array
contains a null-reference.

// Adding values to the list
Let's add the method public void add(A value), which enables adding values to
the list. We have to add an int variable to keep track of the first empty index
in the array.*/

public class List<Type> {

    private Type[] values;
    private int firstFreeIndex;

    public List() {
        this.values = (Type[]) new Object[10];
        this.firstFreeIndex = 0;
    }

    public void add(Type value) {
        this.values[this.firstFreeIndex] = value;
        this.firstFreeIndex++; // same as this.firstFreeIndex = this.firstFreeIndex + 1;
    }
}

/*Now we can add values to the list — or at least we can create a list and call
the add method. We cannot test if the values are actually saved to the list
yet.*/

List<String> myList = new List<>();
myList.add("hello");
myList.add("world");
// Adding values to a list part 2

/*There is a small problem with the add method. The problem occurs when the
following code is run:*/

List<String> myList = new List<>();
for (int i = 0; i < 11; i++) {
    myList.add("hello");
}
// Sample output

// Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 10
//     at dataStructures.List.add(List.java:14)
//     at dataStructures.Program.main(Program.java:8)

/*The size of the list does not grow. One of the benefits of the ArrayList class
is, that it grows as needed — programmers do not have to worry about the list
getting full.

Let's add the functionality for increasing the size of the List. The size of the
List increases if user tries to add a value to a full list. The size of the
List is increased by creating a new, larger, array to which the values from the
old array are copied to. After this the old array is abandoned and the List
starts to use the new array.

The size of the array is determined in Java with the formula oldSize + oldSize /
2. Let's use the same formula in our implementation. We'll create a new method
grow for increasing the size of the array. The method is available only for
other methods in the class (it is private).*/

private void grow() {
    int newSize = this.values.length + this.values.length / 2;
    Type[] newValues = (Type[]) new Object[newSize];
    for (int i = 0; i < this.values.length; i++) {
        newValues[i] = this.values[i];
    }

    this.values = newValues;
}

/*The implementation creates a new array whose size is 1.5 times the size of the
old array. After this all the elements of the old array are copied into the new
one, and finally the value of the object variable values is set to the new
array. The automatic Java garbage collector removes the old array at some
point, now that there are no longer any references to it.

Let's modify the add method so that the size of the array grows when needed.*/

public void add(Type value) {
    if(this.firstFreeIndex == this.values.length) {
        grow();
    }

    this.values[this.firstFreeIndex] = value;
    this.firstFreeIndex++;
}

/*Now we can add almost unlimited amount of elements to the List.

// On the effectiveness of this method
The method described above copies every element from the old array to the new
array. If we would have for example two million elements in an array, we must
go through two million elements while copying them.

We will discuss the effectiveness of this method — and ways to make it more
effective — in the courses Datastructures and Algorithms and Design and
analysis of algorithms.

// Checking the existence of a value
Next we'll create the method public boolean contains(Type value), which we use
to check whether the List contains a value or not. We will make use of the fact
that each Java object — no matter its type — inherits the Object class (or is
type Object). Due to this, each object has the method public boolean equals
(Object object), which we can use to check equality.

The variable firstFreeIndex contains the number of elements in the array. We can
implement the contains method so, that it only checks the indexes in the array
which contain a value.*/

public boolean contains(Type value) {
    for (int i = 0; i < this.firstFreeIndex; i++) {
        if (this.values[i].equals(value)) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
}

We can now inspect the elements in the List.

List<String> myList = new List<>();
System.out.println(myList.contains("hello"));
myList.add("hello");
System.out.println(myList.contains("hello"));
// Sample output
// false
// true

/*The method above assumes, that the user will not add a null reference to the
list, and that the equals method checks that the value given to it as a
parameter is not null.

// Removing a value
We can now add values to the List, and check if the List contains a value. Now
we will implement the functionality for removing a value from the List. Let's
implement the method public void remove(Type value), which removes one value
type value.

Simple implementation would be as follows:*/

public void remove(Type value) {
    for (int i = 0; i < this.firstFreeIndex; i++) {
        if (value == this.values[i] || this.values[i].equals(value)) {
            this.values[i] = null;
            this.firstFreeIndex--;
            return;
        }
    }
}

/*The above implementation is however problematic, because it leaves "empty" slots
to the List, which would lead to the contains method not working.*/

public void remove(T value) {
    boolean found = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < this.firstFreeIndex; i++) {
        if (found) {
            this.values[i - 1] = this.values[i];
        } else if (value == this.values[i] || this.values[i].equals(value)) {
            this.firstFreeIndex--;
            found = true;
        }
    }
}

/*We are not really satisfied with the solution above, because it does too many
things at the same time. The method looks for an element and moves elements
around. We will split the functionality into two methods: private int
indexOfValue(Type value), which searches for the index of the value given to it
as a parameter, and private void moveToTheLeft(int fromIndex), which moves the
elements above the given index to the left.

First let's implement the method private int indexOfValue(Type value), which
searches for the index of the given value. The method returns -1 if the value
is not found.*/

private int indexOfValue(Type value) {
    for (int i = 0; i < this.firstFreeIndex; i++) {
        if (this.values[i].equals(value)) {
            return i;
        }
    }

    return -1;
}

/*Then we will implement the method private void moveToTheLeft(int fromIndex),
which moves values from the given index one place to the left.*/

private void moveToTheLeft(int fromIndex) {
    for (int i = fromIndex; i < this.firstFreeIndex - 1; i++) {
        this.values[i] = this.values[i + 1];
    }
}

// Now we can implement the method remove using these two methods.

public void remove(Type value) {
    int indexOfValue = indexOfValue(value);
    if (indexOfValue < 0) {
        return; // not found
    }

    moveToTheLeft(indexOfValue);
    this.firstFreeIndex--;
}

/*// On the effectiveness of the method
The method describes above copies each element after the removed element one
place to the left. Think about the effectiveness of this method when the List
is used as a queue.

We will discuss the effectiveness of this method — and ways to make it more
effective — in the courses Datastructures and algorithms and Design and
analysis of algorithms.

The class List now contains some repeated code. The method contains is very
similiar to the method indexOfValue. Let's modify the method contains so that
it uses the method indexOfValue.*/

public boolean contains(Type value) {
    return indexOfValue(value) >= 0;
}

/*Now we have a List, which has the methods add, contains, and remove. The List
also grows in size when needed. The implementation of the List could of course
be improved by for example adding functionality for decreasing the size of the
List if the number of values in it decreases.*/

List<String> myList = new List<>();
System.out.println(myList.contains("hello"));
myList.add("hello");
System.out.println(myList.contains("hello"));
myList.remove("hello");
System.out.println(myList.contains("hello"));
// Sample output
// false
// true
// false

/*// Searching from an index
Let's add method public Type value(int index), which returns the value in the
given index of the List. If the user searches for a value in an index outside
of the Array, IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.*/

public Type value(int index) {
    if (index < 0 || index >= this.firstFreeIndex) {
        throw new ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException("Index " + index + " outside of [0, " + this.firstFreeIndex + "]");
    }

    return this.values[index];
}

/*This method would be easier to use, if the user had information about the
indexes of the values. Let's modify the method indexOfValue(Type value) so it
can be used by everyone, so it is public instead of private.*/

public int indexOfValue(Type value) {
    for (int i = 0; i < this.firstFreeIndex; i++) {
        if (this.values[i].equals(value)) {
            return i;
        }
    }

    return -1;
}

List<String> myList = new List<>();

int index = myList.indexOfValue("hello");
System.out.println(index);
System.out.println(myList.value(index));
myList.remove("hello");
System.out.println(myList.contains("hello"));
// Sample output
// false
// true
// 0
// hello
// false

/*// Size of the List
Lastly we will add a method for checking the size of the List. The size of the
list can be determined by the variable firstFreeIndex.*/

public int size() {
    return this.firstFreeIndex;
}

// Now we can use a for-loop to go through the elements of the list.

List<String> myList = new List<>();
myList.add("hello");
myList.add("world");

for(int i = 0; i < myList.size(); i++) {

// Sample output
// hello
// world

// //

/*// Hash map
Hash map is implemented as an array, in which every element includes a list. The
lists contain (key, value) pairs. The user can search from the hash map based
on the key, and they can also add new key-value pairs into it. Each key can
appear at most once in the hash map.

The functioning of the hash map is based on the hash value of the key. When a
new (key, value) pair is stored in a hash map, we calculate a hash value based
on the key to be stored. The hash value decides the index of the internal array
that will be used for storing. The (key, value) pair is stored in the list that
can be found at that index.

Let's sketch out how a hash map functions.

// Key-value pair
Let's start by creating the class Pair that represents a key-value pair. We want
to make the hash map as general as possible, so the types of the key and the
value are determined at run-time. The Pair class contains a key and a value, as
well as the related get methods. The generic types K and V are named so after
the words 'key' and 'value'.*/

public class Pair<K, V> {

    private K key;
    private V value;

    public Pair(K key, V value) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
    }

    public K getKey() {
        return key;
    }

    public V getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public void setValue(V value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
}
// Creating key-value pairs is straightforward.

Pair<String, Integer> pair = new Pair<>("one", 1);
System.out.println(pair.getKey() + " -> " + pair.getValue());
// Sample output
// one -> 1

/*// Creating a hash map
A hash map contains an array of lists. Each value on the list is a pair
(described in the previous section) that contains a key and a value. A hash map
also knows the number of the values. Here we have at our disposal the
previously created class List.*/

public class HashMap<K, V> {

    private List<Pair<K, V>>[] values;
    private int firstFreeIndex;

    public HashMap() {
        this.values = new List[32];
        this.firstFreeIndex = 0;
    }
}

/*// Retrieving a value
Let's implement a method called public V get(K key). It can be used to search
for a value based on a key.

The method begins by calculating a hash value for the key, and using it to
figure out which is the relevant index of the internal array of the hash map.
The hash value is calculated with the hashCode method that each object has.
Then modulo (remainder of division operation) is used for ensuring that the
index stays within the size boundaries of the internal array.

If there is no list in the calculated index, no key-value pairs have been added
to that index. This means that there are no key-value pairs with this key that
have been stored. In this case we'll return the null reference. Otherwise, the
program goes through the list at the index, and we compare the parameter key to
the key of every key-value pair on that list. If some of the keys matches the
parameter key, the method returns the value of that key-value pair. Otherwise
we cannot find a suitable key (and related value), so the method returns the
value null.*/

public V get(K key) {
    int hashValue = Math.abs(key.hashCode() % this.values.length);
    if (this.values[hashValue] == null) {
        return null;
    }

    List<Pair<K, V>> valuesAtIndex = this.values[hashValue];

    for (int i = 0; i < valuesAtIndex.size(); i++) {
        if (valuesAtIndex.value(i).getKey().equals(key)) {
            return valuesAtIndex.value(i).getValue();
        }
    }

    return null;
}

/*// Why not implement hash map as a list?
The main principle of the hash map is that the key-value pairs are divided into
small sets with the help of hash values. In this case a search based on key
demands only going through a very small number of key-value pairs — assuming
that the hash values are calculated in a sensible manner.

If the hash value is always the same — e.g. 1 — the internal implementation of a
hash map is similar to a list — all the values are on the same list. If the
hash values are sufficiently random, the different values are as evenly
distributed to the different lists as possible.

Hash maps also grow the size of their internal array if the number of values
becomes large enough (typically 75% of the size of the array). Typically a hash
map that contains millions of key-value pairs only contains a few key-value
pairs in each index. The practical consequence is that discovering if a
key-value pair exists, we only need to calculate the hash value and examine a
few objects — this is very significantly faster than going through a single
list that contains the entirety of stored values.

// Adding to hash map
Let's implement the first version of the method public void add(K key, V value),
which is used to add values to the hash map. In this version we are not going
to increase the size of the internal array when new values are added to the
hash map.

The method first calculates the hash value for the key, and uses it to determine
the suitable index in the internal array. If there is no value in that index,
we create a list into that index. After this the method goes through the list
at the index, and looks for a key-value pair whose key matches the key of the
key-value pair to be added. If the matching key is found, the value related to
it is updated to match the new value. Otherwise the method adds a new key-value
pair in the list — in which case the number of stored values is also
incremented by one.*/

public void add(K key, V value) {
    int hashValue = Math.abs(key.hashCode() % values.length);
    if (values[hashValue] == null) {
        values[hashValue] = new List<>();
    }

    List<Pair<K, V>> valuesAtIndex = values[hashValue];

    int index = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < valuesAtIndex.size(); i++) {
        if (valuesAtIndex.value(i).getKey().equals(key)) {
            index = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (index < 0) {
        valuesAtIndex.add(new Pair<>(key, value));
        this.firstFreeIndex++;
    } else {
        valuesAtIndex.value(index).setValue(value);
    }
}

/*The method is quite complex, so let's divide it into smaller parts. The first
part is responsible for finding the list related to the key, and the second
part is responsible for finding the key on that list.*/

private List<Pair<K, V>> getListBasedOnKey(K key) {
    int hashValue = Math.abs(key.hashCode() % values.length);

            return i;
        }
    }

    return -1;

/*Now we can write a somewhat clearer implementation of the method public void add
(K key, V value)*/

/*// Adding to hash table, part 2
The way of adding to a hash table that was described above works partly. The
greatest fault in the functionality is that the size of the internal array is
not increased when the number of values grows too large. Let's add a growing
functionality to the program that doubles the size of the internal array of the
hash map. The growing operation should also place each value in the hash map
into the newly created bigger array.

Let's sketch the beginning of the growing functionality. The responsible method
should create a new array whose size is double that of the old array. After
this it goes through the old array, index by index. The encountered key-value
pairs are copied into the new array. Finally, the old array is replaced with
the new one.

implemented the copying yet.*/

of the old array into the new one. When copying, the location of each key-value
pair is recalculated for the new array — this is done because the size of the
internal array grows, and we want to distribute all the key-value pairs in that
array as evenly as possible.*/

private void copy(List<Pair<K, V>>[] newArray, int fromIdx) {
    for (int i = 0; i < this.values[fromIdx].size(); i++) {
        Pair<K, V> value = this.values[fromIdx].value(i);

        grow();
    }
}

/*// Remove
Let's give the hash map the functionality to remove a key-value pair based on
key. The removal functionality returns null if the value cannot be found, and
otherwise it will remove the value that is paired with the key to be removed.

We can take advantage of the method we've already implemented in the removing
method. Explain to yourself (out loud) how the method described below
concretely works.*/

/*The list and hash map that are described in this chapter do have some
differences from the readymade tools we use elsewhere in the course. The data
structures offered by the programming language have more different kinds of
optimizations — other courses go more in detail with these specifics. For the
purposes of this course it's enough to know how to use the data structures and
to have some idea of the performance differences and when they are suitable to
use.*/
