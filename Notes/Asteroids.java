// Larger application: Asteroids

/*// Learning Objectives
You know a way of implementing an interactive game.

You are able to picture how a larger application is built on step by step.

You practice following step by step instructions for building a larger
application.

Asteroids developed by Atari and self published in the year 1979 is a video game
classic. The gameplay consists of the player steering a triangular spaceship,
with the goal of destroying asteroids by shooting them.

What follows is a larger scale example, where we create a part of the Asteroids
game. The game is also an exercise in the course — write the game into the
provided template (at the end of the example) by following the example.

The game is constructed in multiple parts, which are the following:

Creating the game window
Creating the ship
Turning the ship
Moving the ship
Creating an asteroid
The collision between the ship and an asteroid
Multiple asteroids
Staying within the window
Projectiles
Adding points
Continuous adding of asteroids
Let's begin making the application by creating the game window*/

/*// Creating the game window
We will build the application such that the game window may contain an arbitrary
amount of elements, the positions of which will be ignored by the layout used.
This task fits the Pane class. The Pane class contains a list of type
ObservableList containing child elements. The list can be accessed using the
getChildren method of the Pane class.

The program shown below creates a window that is 300 pixels wide and 200 pixels
tall. At the point 30, 50 in the window is a circle with a radius of 10 pixels.
In computer programs it is typical for the origin of the coordinate system is
placed at the top left corner of the window. Additionally the value of the
y-coordinate increases when moving down.*/

        launch(args);
    }
}

/*// Ympyrä ikkunassa.
We call our application AsteroidsApplication. AsteroidsApplication applies the
above example. The application does not add a circle to the window, but we have
provided a title for the application. The width of the window is 600 pixels and
the height is 400 pixels.*/

    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
}

/*// Creating the ship
Next we create the ship. In Asteroids the ship is a triangle. The display of the
triangle is possible using the Polygon class, which is used to represent
polygons. The corners of the polygon are set for the Polygon object, either as
parameters of the constructor or into the list contained within the Polygon
class.

In the example below we have added a parallelogram that is 100 pixels wide and
50 pixels tall using the Polygon class.*/

    Scene scene = new Scene(pane);
    stage.setScene(scene);
    stage.show();
}

/*// Suunnikas ikkunassa.
Moving the polygon into a more fitting position can be done with the provided
methods setTranslateX and setTranslateY of the Polygon class. In the example
below we create a parallelogram just like before, but now the parallelogram has
been moved 100 pixels to the right and 20 pixels down.*/

@Override
public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

}



/*Let's create a triangle representing the ship and add it to our
AsteroidsApplication. We set the triangle at the center of the screen — because
the width of the screen is 600 pixels and the height is 400 pixels, we move the
triangle 300 pixels to the right and 200 pixels down.*/

}

/*// Turning the ship: Keyboard listener, part 1
Classes like Polygon and Circle inherit the Node class of JavaFx. The Node class
has a variable rotate, which describes the rotation of the node in degrees.
Turning any object inheriting the Node class is therefore quite
straightforward — you just use the existing method setRotate. The method is
given the amount to turn in degrees as its parameter.


In the example below we have modified a previous example such that the
parallelogram is rotated 30 degrees.*/

@Override
public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
    Pane pane = new Pane();
    pane.setPrefSize(600, 400);

    Polygon ship = new Polygon(-5, -5, 10, 0, -5, 5);
    ship.setTranslateX(300);
    ship.setTranslateY(200);
    ship.setRotate(30);

    pane.getChildren().add(ship);

    Scene scene = new Scene(pane);
    stage.setScene(scene);
    stage.show();
}

/*In reality we don't want a situation where the ship only turns once, but one in
which we can steer the ship while the game is running.

The Scene object describing the content of the window provides a method
setOnKeyPressed, which can be given an object for handling events as its
parameter. Let's create an event handler, which reacts to events on the
keyboard. Keyboard events have an enumerated variable KeyCode, which tells us
the key that was pressed. We are interested in the keys left (LEFT) and right
(RIGHT).

First we make a test version, in which the turning of the ship is simple. If the
user presses the left arrow, the degrees are set to -30. Then again, if the
user presses the right key, then the degrees are set to 30.*/

scene.setOnKeyPressed(event -> {
    if (event.getCode() == KeyCode.LEFT) {
        ship.setRotate(-30);
    }

    if (event.getCode() == KeyCode.RIGHT) {
        ship.setRotate(30);
    }
});

// If the ship was a parallelogram the functionality would look as follows:


/*The turning can be made smoother by utilizing existing information about the
rotation. In the next example the ship turns five degrees at a time.*/

scene.setOnKeyPressed(event -> {
    if (event.getCode() == KeyCode.LEFT) {
        ship.setRotate(ship.getRotate() - 5);
    }

    if (event.getCode() == KeyCode.RIGHT) {
        ship.setRotate(ship.getRotate() + 5);
    }
});

/*Below is pictured an equivalent example, where instead of rotating the ship we
rotate a parallelogram.


// Turning the ship: Keyboard listener, part 2
The previous approach enables a "kind of OK"-way to turn a node. There is an
issue with the approach — the movement is not smooth. When the key is pressed,
the ship rotates, then takes a short break, after which it continues rotating.

This is related to how programs handle keyboard events by default. If the
program would handle the keypress as multiple events immediately as the key is
pressed, then, for example, writing text would become quite difficult, since
even slightly longer keypresses would immediately generate multiple
characters.

Let's change the handling of keyboard event, such that we keep a record of
pressed keys. This can be done, for example, using a hash table. The hash table
contains the KeyCode object, i.e. the object representing the key, as the key
and a Boolean variable as the value. If the value of the boolean variable of a
particular key is true, then the key is pressed, otherwise the key is not
pressed.

Now we also consider depressing the key, i.e. the onKeyReleased event.*/

Map<KeyCode, Boolean> pressedKeys = new HashMap<>();

scene.setOnKeyPressed(event -> {
    pressedKeys.put(event.getCode(), Boolean.TRUE);
});

scene.setOnKeyReleased(event -> {
    pressedKeys.put(event.getCode(), Boolean.FALSE);
});


/*But! Nothing is currently turning the ship.

Indeed. We still need functionality for rotation. We will start using the
AnimationTimer class, which is meant for creating animations, and assign it the
responsibility of turning the the ship in case the left or right key is
pressed.*/

Map<KeyCode, Boolean> pressedKeys = new HashMap<>();

scene.setOnKeyPressed(event -> {
    pressedKeys.put(event.getCode(), Boolean.TRUE);
});

scene.setOnKeyReleased(event -> {
    pressedKeys.put(event.getCode(), Boolean.FALSE);
});

new AnimationTimer() {

    @Override
    public void handle(long now) {
        if(pressedKeys.getOrDefault(KeyCode.LEFT, false)) {
            ship.setRotate(ship.getRotate() - 5);
        }

        if(pressedKeys.getOrDefault(KeyCode.RIGHT, false)) {
            ship.setRotate(ship.getRotate() + 5);
        }
    }
}.start();

/*The handle method of the AnimationTimer class is called approximately 60 times
per second. Now the rotation is much smoother (however, it is not very apparent
in the gif below...).


// Moving the ship: First attempt
It's now possible to rotate the ship. Next, we'll add the possibility to move
around. The ship should be able to move in any cardinal direction, which means
that we need values for both x and y coordinates to represent movement. The
concrete implementation of the movement is to modify the position of the
polygon that represents the ship while the program is running.

Let's make use of the existing Point2D Java class to represent movement — the
class has both x and y coordinates.

The first test version is to create a movement variable and adding it to the
AnimationTimer class's handle method.*/

Point2D movement = new Point2D(1, 0);
new AnimationTimer() {

    @Override
    public void handle(long now) {
        if(pressedKeys.getOrDefault(KeyCode.LEFT, false)) {
            ship.setRotate(ship.getRotate() - 5);
        }

        if(pressedKeys.getOrDefault(KeyCode.RIGHT, false)) {
            ship.setRotate(ship.getRotate() + 5);
        }

        ship.setTranslateX(ship.getTranslateX() + movement.getX());
    }
}.start();

/*Hurray! The ship is moving (and it can be rotated). Although it disappears quite
quickly...


The class that we chose, Point2D, is like the String class in some regards —
namely, it is immutable so it cannot be modified. We cannot change the values
of an existing point, and calling the methods of a point always returns a new
point value. This poses something of a problem, since we cannot set the values
of the objects to something else inside methods. The following solution is
therefore ruled out.*/

new AnimationTimer() {

    @Override
    public void handle(long now) {
        // .. does not work ..

        // ..
    }

/*However, method calls are allowed. Looks like it's time for refactoring and
clearing up the structure of the program...

// Moving the ship: Refactoring
Let's create a class called Ship, which contains a Polygon object and a Point2D
object. The Polygon object represents the ship, and the Point2D object
represents the movement of the ship. The ship receives the x and y coordinates
of the ship as its constructor parameters. The ship can be rotated left or
right.*/

import javafx.geometry.Point2D;
import javafx.scene.shape.Polygon;

/*This refactoring leads to changes in the program in a couple of places. Instead
of the point to represent movement and a polygon to represent the ship, we will
create a Ship. In addition, the Pane object is given the Polygon object of the
ship, but not the Ship object itself.*/

Ship ship = new Ship(150, 100);

The ship moves, but it's not possible to affect the movement yet. Let's add an
acceleration functionality to the shpi. The ship should accelerate so that the
speed accelerates to the direction that the ship points to. We can get the
acceleration information from the rotation degree, which we can use the
getRotate() method. We have already become well acquainted with it in rotating
the ship.

The direction of the acceleration can be figured out with sine and cosine
functions. The existing Java Math class contains the relevant methods. The
methods assume their parameters to be in radians, so we are also going to need
the Math class method that converts degrees into radians.*/

quite high, so it should be tweaked somewhat. Let's modify the accelerate

// Creating an asteroid
Next up, we are going to create an asteroid. An asteroid has a shape, position,

Hmm..

Come to think of it, these are almost exactly the same things that a ship
needs — the only difference is in the shape. This is a good moment to
generalize. We'll create an abstract class called Character, which receives a

basic shape is always a pentagon. We can add variance to their shapes by moving
the locations of the corners a little.

have been partially defined in the Character class, but we want to add some
randomness to the movement. When an asteroid is created, it's direction should
be a random number between [0, 360]. Asteroids also move a little — the
movement is defined as a random number of acceleration calls when the character
is created. Finally an asteroid also rotates. Each time an asteroid moves, it
also rotates a little.*/

is called, it first calls the move method from the Character class. Then the
character is rotated. The final product is an asteroid with some rotational
movement.


// Staying within the window
The application is a bit boring, because the asteroids and the ship can leave
the screen. Let's modify it so, that the characters stay on screen.

We will define constants width and height for the AsteroidsApplication. Each

variables WIDTH and HEIGHT, which can be referenced elsewhere in the program
code.*/

characters sometimes "jump" from one side of the screen to the other. The size
of the character is not taken into account, so its x- or y -coordinates can be
outside of the screen, even if part of the character stays visible. We
can —probably— solve this problem with the getBoundsInParent-method of the
Node -class. However we will not go more into it here.

// Projectiles
Playing asteroids without projectiles would be just dodging asteroids. Next we
will add projectiles. Projectiles have a shape, a direction and movement. We
can use the Character class for creating projectiles. Let's create the first
version of the Projectile-class. For now all projectiles are squares.*/

empty for now.*/

We want to be able to modify the movement of a projectile. However, currently
the move method of a Character is private, and we have to access to it through
other methods. Let's add getMovement and setMovement to the Character class.

Now setting the speed of a projectile is straightforwards. We accelerate the
speed of a projectile a bit (so it never stays put) and normalize the speed
(in practice we handle the speed as a vector with the length of 1). Here the
speed is multiplied by three.*/

lot of them... Let's limit the number of projectiles a bit — we can decide that
there can only be 3 projectiles at once.*/

/*The lines at the end are almost identical — both are handling characters. Maybe
we could refactor this a bit.*/


/*// Adding points
Asteroids games almost always have a some sort of a points system. The points
are displayed as text-objects, value of which changes when the number of points
changes. We can decide that a player gets 1000 points every time they destroy
an asteroid.

The Java Text -class is great for this purpose. A Text object has coordinates
and content. In the example below the player always has 0 points.*/

this is the AtomicInteger-class, which offers integers as encapsulated objects.

        }
    }.start();
}


/*Now we can display the number of points and increase it. Let's connect the
points to the game so, that the number of points increases every time player's
projectile hits an asteroid.

This can be done as a part of collision between a projectile and an asteroid.*/

projectiles.forEach(projectile -> {
    asteroids.forEach(asteroid -> {
        if(projectile.collide(asteroid)) {
            projectile.setAlive(false);

/*Now, if the increasing of points has been removed from the start of the
animation timer, player gets points when they hit an asteroid.

// Continuous adding of asteroids
When we hit an asteroid, they disappear, and soon there is nothing to shoot.
This is not acceptable!

We will add a function which adds asteroids throughout the game. A new asteroid
is added with the probability of 0.5% each time the AnimationTimer-object is
called. A new asteroid is added only if it does not collide with a ship
immediately.

The handle method of an AnimationTimer-object is called approximately 60 times a
second, so in ten seconds a few asteroids are added. We add the call to the end
of the handle -method.*/

NB! By submitting a solution to a part of an exercise which has multiple parts,
you can get part of the exercise points. You can submit a part by using
the 'submit' button on NetBeans. More on the programming exercise submission
instructions: Exercise submission instructions.

The exercise template contains an empty program template. Create the Asteroids
game by following the preceding example of a large application.

While you are creating the game, remember to update the method partsCompleted in
the AsteroidsApplication class such that it returns the number of the part you
have completed. You may submit the exercise even if you don't complete all of
the parts, in which case you will receive points for the parts you have
completed.

When you have completed the exercise you may keep going if you like. E.g. you
could add sounds and different characters — how would, for example, aliens work
in the game? Would they try to shoot the ship of the player?

Part 1

Implement the steps presented at the start of the material (1) creating the game
window, (2) creating the ship, and (3) turning the ship.

When you have these parts working, set the return value of the partsCompleted
method of the AsteroidsApplication class to 1.

Part 2

Add functionality for moving the ship to the Asteroids game as presented in the
material.

When you have these, and the previous parts working, set the return value of the
partsCompleted method of the AsteroidsApplication class to 2.

Part 3

Extend the Asteroids game with (1) creating an asteroid, (2) the collision
between ship and asteroid, and (3) adding multiple asteroids.

When you have these, and the previous parts working, set the return value of the
partsCompleted method of the AsteroidsApplication class to 3.

Part 4

Extend the Asteroids game by adding the rest of the game functionality, i.e.
(1) staying within the window, (2) projectiles, (3) adding points, and
(4) adding new asteroids.

When you have these, and the previous parts working, set the return value of the
partsCompleted method of the AsteroidsApplication class to 4.*/
