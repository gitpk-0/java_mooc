/* STRING BUILDER */

/*We'll now take a look at some useful programming techniques and classes.

// StringBuilder
Let's look at the following program.*/

String numbers = "";
for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
    numbers = numbers + i;
}
System.out.println(numbers);
// Sample output
// 1234

/*The program structure is straightforward. A string containing the number 1234 is
created, and the string is then outputted.

The program works, but there is a small problem invisible to the user. Calling
numbers + i creates a new string. Let's inspect the program line-by-line with
the repetition block unpacked.*/

String numbers = ""; // creating a new string: ""
int i = 1;
numbers = numbers + i; // creating a new string: "1"
i++;
numbers = numbers + i; // creating a new string: "12"
i++;
numbers = numbers + i; // creating a new string: "123"
i++;
numbers = numbers + i; // creating a new string: "1234"
i++;

System.out.println(numbers); // printing the string

/*In the previous example, five strings are created in total.

Let's look at the same program where a new line is added after each number.*/

String numbers = "";
for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
    numbers = numbers + i + "\n";
}
System.out.println(numbers);
// Sample output
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4

/*Each +operation forms a new string. On the line numbers + i + "\n"; a string is
first created, after which another string is created joining a new line onto
the previous string. Let's write this out as well.
*/
String numbers = ""; // creating a new string: ""
int i = 1;
// first creating the string "1" and then the string "1\n"
numbers = numbers + i + "\n";
i++;
// first creating the string "1\n2" and then the string "1\n2\n"
numbers = numbers + i + "\n"
i++;
// first creating the string "1\n2\n3" and then the string "1\n2\n3\n"
numbers = numbers + i + "\n"
i++;
// and so on
numbers = numbers + i + "\n"
i++;

System.out.println(numbers); // outputting the string

/*In the previous example, a total of nine strings is created.

String creation - although unnoticeable at a small scale - is not a quick
operation. Space is allocated in memory for each string where the string is
then placed. If the string is only needed as part of creating a larger string,
performance should be improved.

Java's ready-made StringBuilder class provides a way to concatenate strings
without the need to create them. A new StringBuilder object is created with a
new StringBuilder() call, and content is added to the object using the
overloaded append method, i.e., there are variations of it for different types
of variables. Finally, the StringBuilder object provides a string using the
toString method.

In the example below, only one string is created.*/

StringBuilder numbers = new StringBuilder();
for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
    numbers.append(i);
}
System.out.println(numbers.toString());

/*Using StringBuilder is more efficient than creating strings with the + operator.*/
