/* GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE */

/*We'll now take a look at creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). When
creating graphical user interfaces, we mostly make use of user-interface
libraries that provide us with ready-made components, such as buttons and text
areas. These user-interface libraries take care of the drawing the components
for us, meaning that we don't have to draw every single component in our
program, only add them to it.

Whereas text interfaces have the functionality coupled to a particular form of
input, in GUIs it's added to the user-interface components. A programmer can,
for instance, add a method to a button that lives on the interface, which
handles an event associated with that button.

We'll be using Java's [JavaFx]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaFX) user-interface library to create our
graphical user interfaces. The applications we develop are desktop
applications. 

Graphical User Interfaces and Required Libraries 

A library calledJavaFX is used to create graphical user interfaces. On Linux
machines, you may have to install the openjfx library — depending on how Java's
installed. You can install this in Ubuntu (from the command line) with the
command:

user@computer:~$ sudo apt-get install openjfx

A test library called [TestFX] (https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX/wiki) is used
in the exercise templates to test JavaFx programs. This library is included in
the templates.

Required Rights on macOS for Exercise Tests

Some of the tests in this section assume that tmcbeans is able to freely move
the cursor around the screen. On macOS (Apple computers), tmcbeans has to be
granted this right explicitly. Here are instructions on how to grant this
right: [macOS help] (/macos help)

We can create a simple window using JavaFX with the following program.*/

package application;

import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class JavaFxApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage window) {
        window.setTitle("Hello World!");
        window.show();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(JavaFxApplication.class);
    }
}

// When the program is launched, it looks as follows.

// Empty window with a 'Hello World' title

/*When the launch method is called, the method of the Application class creates a
new object from the given class (here JavaFxApplication) and calls its init
method. The init method is defined in the Application class and is used, for
instance, to initialize objects of a program. After calling the init method,
the program calls the start method, which gets a [Stage]
(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/stage/Stage.html) object as
its parameter, which describes the window. In the implementation of the start
method above, the setTitle method sets the title of the Stage-type window
object obtained as a parameter. The method show is then called, which leads to
the window being displayed. The program then stays in a state where it
continuously listens to events on user interface, such as closing the window
that causes the application to shut down.*/

// //

    // Structure of a User Interface

/*Graphical user interfaces consist of three essential parts. The Stage object
behaves as the program's window. A [Scene]
(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/Scene.html) is set
for a Stage object that represents a scene within the window. The Scene object,
on the other hand, contains an object responsible for arranging the components
belonging to the scene (such as FlowPane), which contains the actual user
interface components.

The program below creates an interface with a single button.*/

package application;

import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.scene.layout.FlowPane;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class JavaFxApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage window) {
        Button button = new Button("This is a button");

        FlowPane componentGroup = new FlowPane();
        componentGroup.getChildren().add(button);

        Scene scene = new Scene(componentGroup);

        window.setScene(scene);
        window.show();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(JavaFxApplication.class);
    }
}

// The application looks like this.

// A window, which has a button. The button contains the text 'This is a button'.

/*UI components are added as "children" to the object responsible for setting
them — FlowPane. This has to do with a JavaFx design decision, whereby each
object responsible for UI components may contain other objects responsible for
UI components as well as actual UI components. This enables GUIs where the
layout of the UI components depends on their location on the user interface.
For example, menu items located at the top of a UI are usually placed side by
side, while list items are placed one below the other.

To briefly summarize, the UI structure is as follows. The window contains a
Scene object. The Scene object contains the object responsible for the layout
of the user-interface components. The object responsible for the component
layout can contain both UI components and objects responsible for UI component
layouts.*/
